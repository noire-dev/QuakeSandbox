-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
