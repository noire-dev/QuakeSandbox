 Q3MAP2 ENTITIES

=============================================================================
-->

<group name="_decal" color="0 1.0 0">
-------- KEYS --------
<target key="target" name="Target">The name of the entity targeted for projection.</target>
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies a decal to be projected. Should contain 1 or more patch meshes (curves) and target an info_null entity. Patch mesh should be using a shader with "polygonoffset" (or other blending methods) or z-fighting will occur. The distance between the center of the _decal entity and the target is the axis and distance of projection.
</group>

<point name="_skybox" color="0.77 0.88 1.0" box="-4 -4 -4 4 4 4">
-------- KEYS --------
<angle key="angle" name="Yaw Angle">Rotation angle of the sky surfaces.</angle>
<angles key="angles" name="Pitch Yaw Roll">Individual control of PITCH, YAW, and ROLL (default 0 0 0).</angles>
<real key="_scale" name="Scale" value="64">Scaling factor (default 64), good values are between 50 and 300, depending on the map.</real>
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies the origin of a skybox (a wholly contained, separate area of the map), similar to some games portal skies. When compiled with Q3Map2, the skybox surfaces will be visible from any place where sky is normally visible. It will cast shadows on the normal parts of the map, and can be used with cloud layers and other effects.

<point name="ammo_bfg" color=".3 .3 1" box="-16 -16 -16 16 16 16" model="models/powerups/ammo/bfgam.md3">
BFG ammo. Gives the player 15 by default.
-------- KEYS --------
<real key="wait" name="Respawn Delay" value="40">Time in seconds before item respawns after being picked up (default 40, -1 = never respawn).</real>
<real key="random" name="Respawn Delay Variance" value="0">Random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see notes).</real>
<integer key="count" name="Ammo Given" value="15">Sets the amount of ammo given to the player when picked up (default 15).</integer>
<string key="team" name="Team Name">Set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn randomly after team master is picked up (see notes).</string>
<target key="target" name="Target">Picking up the item will trigger the entity this points to.</target>
<targetname key="targetname" name="Target Name">A target_give entity, pointed to this, gives the item to player. Activating this by other entities will make the item to respawn.</targetname>
<target key="target2" name="Target 2">Picking up the item will trigger the entity this points to.</target>
<targetname key="targetname2" name="Target Name 2">A target_give entity, pointed to this, gives the item to player. Activating this by other entities will make the item to respawn.</targetname>

<flag key="SILENT" name="No Pickup Sound" bit="1">No sound will be played when picking up this item.</flag>
-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

<flag key="SILENT" name="No Pickup Sound" bit="1">No sound will be played when picking up this item.</flag>
-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

-------- NOTES --------
Unlike in Quake 2, doors that touch are NOT automatically teamed. If you want doors to operate together, you have to team them manually by assigning the same team name to all of them. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by the origin brush.

Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model's "target" key to the same value as this entity's "targetname"). Note: func_door and func_plat targeted by a misc_model will also require a trigger_* entity with the same target key/value as the model.

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. The center of that brush will be the point through which the rotation axis passes. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. You can check the X_AXIS, Y_AXIS or Z_AXIS boxes to determine along which axes rotation should occur. If no boxes are checked the entity will rotate along the Z axis. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.It will rotate around the Z axis by default. You can check either the X_AXIS or Y_AXIS box to change that.Contrary to using the targetname key, the targetname2 key will not prevent the door from opening when a player comes nearby.

-------- NOTES --------
Unlike in Quake 2, doors that touch are NOT automatically teamed. If you want doors to operate together, you have to team them manually by assigning the same team name to all of them. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by the origin brush.

Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model's "target" key to the same value as this entity's "targetname"). Note: func_door and func_plat targeted by a misc_model will also require a trigger_* entity with the same target key/value as the model.

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. The center of that brush will be the point through which the rotation axis passes. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. You can check the X_AXIS, Y_AXIS or Z_AXIS boxes to determine along which axes rotation should occur. If no boxes are checked the entity will rotate along the Z axis. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.It will rotate around the Z axis by default. You can check either the X_AXIS or Y_AXIS box to change that.Contrary to using the targetname key, the targetname2 key will not prevent the door from opening when a player comes nearby.

-------- NOTES --------
When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).When a count has been set, the timer will turn itself off when it has activate its target the specified number of times. After the timer has been turned off (either by hitting the count limit or by being triggered by another entity again), the counter towards its count limit is reset.

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

1. Trains always start on in the game.
2. Trains do not damage the played when blocked.
3. Trains cannot emit sound.
4. Trains are not triggerable or toggle-able.
5. Trains cannot be block-stopped just by getting in their way, the player must be wedged between the train and another obstacle to block it.

You need to have an origin brush (textured by common/origin) as part of this entity. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by the origin brush.

Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model's "target" key to the same value as this entity's "targetname").

Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model's "target" key to the same value as this entity's "targetname").Setting the startsound or endsound keys will allow the train to play a sound when it stops moving at a path_corner entity or when it starts moving again. Enter a reference to a wav file here, like "sound/movers/doors/dr1_strt.wav".

-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

In genuine bot arena matches, the podium for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place players at the end of the match is generated by this entity. The podium's origin will automatically be located 128 units in the direction of the camera's view and 84 units down from the y height of the view line at that point. It will also always be generated on a level plane regardless of the pointing angle of the camera so if that angle is too steep, part of the podium model might not be visible. Make sure you leave at least 106 units of free space in front of where the camera points to otherwise the podium model won't be visible at all.

-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

-------- NOTES --------
The item_botroam entity can be used when a bot does not roam the whole level or prefers to go to only specific areas. This (invisible) item can be placed in a map just like regular items. Nobody can actually pick up the item it's only used to attract bots to certain places of the map. The value is the weight of the roam_item is relative to the weight assigned other items in the map (each bot has its own weights). The bot character specific item weights are stored with the bot characters AI files ("botname"_i.c for items and "botname"_w.c for weapons) in the botfiles/bots/ sub-folder in the .pk3 file.

-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

-------- NOTES --------
By default bots spawn without any weapons. Use spawnflags to customize the set of weapons the bot will spawn with. Bots will always have unlimited ammo for all weapons. The choice of weapon is still up to the bot. This means that spawning a bot with a MG and GL doesn't guarantee the bot will use the GL.Setting the skill key works like a modifier on top of the current skill level. So a skill value of 1 means the bot is one skill level tougher than the current skill setting. A skill value of -2 means the bot is two skill levels lower than the current setting. A bot's relative skill level never drops below 1 but may rise above 5. Floating point values (like 1.3) are allowed.Note that the Radiant level editor will not display targetting paths for the deathtarget key.When bot PATROL_WALK and ALWAYS_WALK are set, the bot will always walk and ignore the PATROL_WALK spawnflag.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

a) Automatically give items to players when they spawn in the game: Make a spawn location entity like info_player_deathmatch or CTF respawn, targeting this entity, then target it to the item(s) to give to the player upon respawn.
b) Give items to players during the game: Make a trigger_multiple/func_button/other_activatable_entity target this entity, then make it target the item(s) to give to the player when the trigger is touched.

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a "bottomless pit" in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the "noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your levels.

The combination of the "wait" and "random" keys can be used to play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but both keys must be used together. The value of the "random" key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

-------- Q3MAP2 KEYS --------
<integer key="gridsize" name="Dynamic Light Granularity" value="64 64 128">Granularity of the lightgrid, created by q3map, which is used to dynamically light certain game objects, like players and items. Value is three integers separated by spaces, representing number of units between grid points in X Y Z. Default gridsize value is 64 64 128. Use larger powers of 2 to reduce BSP size and compile time on very large maps.</integer>
<integer key="_blocksize" name="BSP Block Size" value="1024 1024 1024">Map compiler splits the BSP tree along axial planes (X, Y and Z) for optimization. It does it as often, as specified in _blocksize key for respective axis (in units) (default 1024 1024 1024, 0 = disable, setting single value 'N' equals to setting 'N N N'). I.e. lower values result in more splits and vice versa. Increase the blocksize using larger powers of 2 to reduce compile times on very large maps with a low structural brush density. Maps, having flat architecture, might work better with horizontal splits disabled ('N N 0').</integer>
<real key="_ambient" name="Ambient Intensity" value="0">Adds a constant value to overall lighting (default 0, range 0 - 255). Only recommended use is small values for cosmetic purposes, as high values will have a tendency to flatten out variations in light and shade.</real>
<color key="_color" name="Ambient Color" value="1 1 1">RGB color value for ambient and other global light parameters (default is 1 1 1).</color>
<real key="_minlight" name="Min Lightmap Intensity" value="0">Minimum light value, levelwide. Uses the _color key to set color. Since it does not add unlike ambient, but overrides existing light values, affected areas will get flat constant light. Therefore use is highly not recommended!</real>

<integer key="_castshadows" name="Shadow Caster Level" value="1">Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting. 1 = cast shadows on world. &gt; 1 = cast shadows on entities with _rs (or _receiveshadows) with the corresponding value, AND world. Negative values imply same, but DO NOT cast shadows on world.</integer>
<integer key="_receiveshadows" name="Shadow Receiver Level" value="1">Allows per-entity control over shadow reception. Defaults to 1 on everything (world shadows). 0 = receives NO shadows. &gt; 1 = receive shadows only from corresponding keyed entities (see above) and world. &lt; 1 = receive shadows ONLY from corresponding keyed entities.</integer>
